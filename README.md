# VAEs for higher-quality image generation

Third Year Project: This repository contains various VAE implementations and their corresponding results obtained via training them: Convolutional VAE, IntroVAE, PixelVAE, VAE/GAN.

Note that the datasets were removed from the workspace due to space constraints.
For CIFAR-10, no modification should be needed as the dataset is downloaded automatically.
In order to use this code for CelebA, download the dataset into the "celeb/celeb" path.

Also note that some of the results we did when running the models have been removed, also due to space constraints.

Credits for the architectures we experimented with and for general development ideas go to the following GitHub users:
* jonhare - Dr. Jonathon Hare - Convolutional VAE
* pbloem - Dr. Peter Bloem - PixelVAE
* dragen1860 - Jackie Loong - IntroVAE
* seangal - VAE/GAN
* bbeatrix - IntroVAE.
