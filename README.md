# VAEs for higher-quality image generation

This repository contains various VAE implementations and their corresponding results obtained via training them: Convolutional VAE, IntroVAE, PixelVAE, VAE/GAN.

Third Year Project Report can be consulted [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/vnkh7tqct5sn05g47bgto/Report.pdf?rlkey=qrtt4q4nrgrii9bazfej1u6fp&raw=1).

Note that the datasets were removed from the workspace due to space constraints.
For CIFAR-10, no modification should be needed as the dataset is downloaded automatically.
In order to use this code for CelebA, download the dataset into a "celeb/celeb" path.

Credits for the architectures we experimented with and for general development ideas go to the following GitHub users:
* jonhare - Dr. Jonathon Hare - Convolutional VAE
